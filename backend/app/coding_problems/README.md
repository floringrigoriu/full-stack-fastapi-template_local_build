# Coding Problems Unit Tests

This folder contains Python unit tests for coding problems implemented in this directory.

## Test Files

- `test_problem1.py`: Unit tests for the function `countTrapezoids` in `problem1.py`, which counts the number of unique trapezoids that can be formed from a set of points.
- `test_problem2.py`: Unit tests for the function `countCollisions` in `Problem2.py`, which counts the number of collisions based on a string of directions.

Each test file uses Python's `unittest` framework and provides multiple test cases to validate the correctness of the corresponding solution implementation.
